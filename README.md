# LoggerServer

**Message Server**

## Task 1
- Implement a public function `log/2` that accepts a message and the severity of that message. Store that message along with its severity for later retrieval.

## Task 2
- Implement a public function `get_log_by_id/1` that accepts the message id and returns the message.

## Task 3
- Implement an interval that at the end of each time period, writes to the console the number of `:high` severity messages that were logged in that time.
